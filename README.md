Cybersecurity Investigation: Identifying a Facebook Recruitment Scam

1. Project Title

Investigation of a Fake Amazon Job Posting on Facebook

2. Objective

To analyze and expose a fraudulent job scam on Facebook that used fake recruitment tactics, suspicious URLs, and misleading information to deceive people.

3. Steps Taken

Step 1: Discovering the Scam

I found a Facebook advertisement claiming to hire "Amazon Assistants."

The job post required basic English skills and general knowledge, which seemed normal.

Clicking the ad led me directly to their Facebook group instead of an official hiring page.


Step 2: Chatting with the Scammer

I messaged the recruiter and asked for job details.

Instead of providing job descriptions, he asked for my name and age.

When I requested specific job details, he insisted I answer questions first.

He then sent me a WhatsApp group link and claimed the job paid "500 Rupiah" (which is extremely low, raising red flags).


Step 3: Investigating the Suspicious Elements

The scammer's phone number was Indonesian, but his IP address was from the USA—a major inconsistency.

Indonesians rarely speak fluent English in informal settings, making the interaction seem suspicious.

I copied the URL he sent and checked it on VirusTotal → The site was flagged for malicious activity.

Further analysis of the URL revealed it was 100% suspicious—likely a phishing or malware site.


Step 4: Taking Action

Blocked and reported the scammer on Facebook and WhatsApp.

Warned my classmates about similar scams and advised them not to click unknown links.

Documented my findings as a cybersecurity learning experience.


4. Key Findings

Red Flags Identified:

Fake job ads redirecting to unofficial groups instead of professional websites.

Recruiter avoiding specific job details and demanding personal information first.

Fake salary claim ("500 Rupiah"), which is illogical for any real job.

Mismatch between phone number location (Indonesia) and IP address (USA).

Malicious URL linked to scam activities.



5. Security Recommendations

To avoid falling for similar scams:

Verify job listings on official company websites (Amazon only hires through their official careers page).

Never share personal information (name, age, ID) before verifying the company.

Check URLs before clicking using tools like VirusTotal and URLscan.io.

Look for inconsistencies (e.g., different country phone numbers and IP addresses).

Educate others—Report scams and inform friends/family to prevent them from being targeted.


6. Conclusion

This investigation exposed a well-planned recruitment scam using fake job offers to lure victims. By analyzing the recruiter’s behavior, checking URLs, and verifying IP addresses, I successfully identified and avoided the scam. This case highlights the importance of cybersecurity awareness and proactive threat detection.
